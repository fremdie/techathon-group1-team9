## Team's Process 

- The team had a brainstorming session, where we came up with the name for the project. The graphics dessigners went ahead and came up with logo designs until one was finally decided on. They also came up with the colors, fonts, and icons for the project.
- The product designers came up with a lo-fi wireframe, which aided the initial work of the developers - figuring out sections and backbone of the work to be done.
- Subsequently, the hi-fi design was completed, which the developers implemented by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


### Built With 
- Figma (for design)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What was learned
